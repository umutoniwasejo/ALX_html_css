# Headphones Project

This project is a responsive web page designed to showcase headphones, with interactions tailored for both desktop and mobile views. The design includes specific hover effects, mobile responsiveness, and content constraints to ensure a clean and modern user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** 
  - The webpage switches to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
  - Desktop version: Content is centered with a max width of 1000px.
  
- **Interactive States:**
  - **Links Hover/Active:** On hover or when active, the link color changes to `#FF6565`.
  - **Button Hover/Active:** On hover or when active, buttons change opacity to `0.9` to provide visual feedback.

## Fonts

The project uses custom fonts that you must install on your system to ensure proper display:

- **Source Sans Pro**: [Google Fonts - Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- **Spin Cycle OT**: (Please ensure you have this font, or use a similar alternative)

If the fonts are missing, Figma will use default system fonts.
